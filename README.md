# EI-with-adaptation

This code simulates the E-I population model in XPPAUT. This project has been done at the european computational neuroscience course
in Poland, Bedlewo (http://www.neuroinf.pl/accn). I was modeling the epileptic oscillations in the context of the neural populaiton
model. Sooner or later this project will be published.
