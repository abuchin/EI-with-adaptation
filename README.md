# EI-with-adaptation

This code simulates the E-I population model in XPPAUT. This code allows to generate the time series of the population activity in the excitatory and inhibitory cells during seizure and towards transition to seizure. To run the model with the noise simulation, run EI_Cress_pop_AHP_bif_noise.ode in Fig_2 folder using Xppaut. To perform the bifurcation analysis / generate simulations in the model without the noise, run EI_Cress_pop_AHP_bif_NO_noise.ode in Fig_4 folder. Parts of this project has been done at the european computational neuroscience course in Poland, Bedlewo (http://www.neuroinf.pl/accn).
